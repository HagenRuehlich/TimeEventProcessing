# TimeEventProcessing
This project is a kind of event processing for Rapberry Pi.  Events are here characterized by the time and days the event should be executed
and an action to be done then. An example for actions is switching on/off a radio controlled socked. The processor is just aware of abstract
events, concrete action like the mentioned switching of radio controlled sockets are implemented in sub classes. The events itself are defined 
in a XML file. Please note everything here has been written by a Python beginner....
